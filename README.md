# cs236781-project
Final project of CS236781

The following list details what your project report should contain and its impact on the grade.

## Abstract (10%). 
Summarize your work. Briefly introduce the problem, the methods and state the key results.

## Intro (25%). 
Review the papers relevant to your project. Explain the problem domain, existing approaches and the specific contribution of the relevant paper(s). Also detail the drawbacks which you plan to address. If itâ€™s a custom project, explain your specific motivation and goals. Cite any other work as needed.

## Methods (25%). 
If implementing an existing paper, explain the original approach as well as your ideas for modifications, additions or improvements to the algorithm/task/domain etc., as relevant. Otherwise, provide a detailed explanation of your approach. In both cases, explain the empirical and/or theoretical motivation for what you are doing. Finally, describe the data you will be using for evaluation.

## Implementation and experiments (20%). 
Describe the experiments performed and their configurations, what was compared to what and the evaluation metrics used and why. Explain all implementation details such as model architectures used, data preprocessing/augmentation approaches, loss formulations, training methods and hyperparameter values.

Note: You can use existing code, e.g. in your implementation but specify what you used and which parts you implemented yourself.

## Results (20%). 
Present all results in an orderly table and include graphs or figures as you see fit. Discuss, analyze and explain your results. Compare to previous works and other approaches for your task.
